# 📚 Exploratory Data Analysis & Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews  

This repository contains one of my early projects in data science, where I explored a dataset of book reviews and applied sentiment analysis to understand reader opinions.  

Even though it’s a beginner-level project, it helped me learn practical steps of data analysis, visualization, and natural language processing (NLP).  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on book reviews dataset to identify patterns and distributions.  
- Applied **sentiment analysis** to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.  
- Visualized trends and sentiment results with Python libraries.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full code.  
- `Eda+Sentiment.html` → HTML export of the notebook (for easy viewing without Jupyter).  
- `report.pdf` (optional) → PDF version of the notebook with outputs.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- NLTK / TextBlob / VADER (depending on sentiment model used)  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Visualized distribution of ratings and text lengths of reviews.  
- Identified most frequent words in positive vs. negative reviews.  
- Classified review sentiments and analyzed their proportions.

## 📈 Example Visuals
(Sample plots from the notebook will appear in the `.ipynb` or `.html` file.)

## 📑 Dataset
- Source: [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews)]  
- If dataset is too large or restricted, only references are provided.  

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with **data cleaning, visualization, and NLP basics**.  
- Understood how to build a simple sentiment analysis pipeline.  
- This project laid the foundation for more advanced analytics work.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Try different sentiment models (BERT, HuggingFace transformers).  
- Deploy a simple web app (e.g., Streamlit) for live sentiment predictions.  
- Extend analysis to compare genres, authors, or review trends over time.
